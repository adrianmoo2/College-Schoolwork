# College-Schoolwork
Labs / relevant coursework completed during university. 


This repository contains all of my programming coursework completed during university.
I have much more coursework, but those are not coding related. To help identify which
course did what, I will write brief descriptions for each:

CS100: Development and construction of higher-level software protocols. Topics covered 
included design, coding layout, style, implementation strategies, quality attributes, 
personal software processes, and more. The labs in this folder dealt with class structure
and design strategies. Coded in C++.

CS12: Intermediate C++ programming. Topics included recursion, strings, pointers, classes, 
friends, operator overloading, inheritance, virtual functions, templates, linked lists, and 
more. The labs in this folder aimed to increase C++ familiarity, as well as familiarity with 
the aforementioned topics. Coded in C++.

CS14: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms / Advanced C++ Programming. Topics
covered dynamic data structures (linked lists, queues, stacks), introduction to algorithms,
sorting, trees, graphs, and hashing. The labs in this folder aimed to increase C++
familiarity, as well as familiarty with the aforementioned topics. Coded in C++.

CS172: Introduction to Information Retrieval. Topics covered included Vector Model,
Probabilistic IR, IR evaluation methods, Web Search, Social Networks Search, and more.
The program in this folder is the class's final project, and is divided into two phases.
The first phase dealt with building a Web Crawler for .edu pages, and the second phase
dealt with building an index and Web-based search interface. I worked with two others.
We used the Eclipse IDE, and coded in Java.

EE120B: Introduction to Embedded Systems. Topics covered included embedded processor
programing, custom processor design, standard peripherals, memories, interfacing, and
hardware / software tradeoffs. Interdisciplinary laboratory involved used of synthesis
tools (i.e. soldering), programmable logic, microcontrollers, and development of
working embedded systems. For this class, I worked with a breadboard using the Atmega1284
microcontroller, as well as other circuitry parts. I used Atmel Studio, and coded in C.
