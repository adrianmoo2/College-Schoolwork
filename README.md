# College-Schoolwork
Labs / relevant coursework completed during university. 


This repository contains all of my programming coursework completed during university.
I have much more coursework, but those are not coding related. To help identify which
course did what, I will write brief descriptions for each:

CS100: Development and construction of higher-level software protocols. Topics covered 
included design, coding layout, style, implementation strategies, quality attributes, 
personal software processes, and more. The labs in this folder dealt with class structure
and design strategies. Coded in C++.

CS12: Intermediate C++ programming. Topics included recursion, strings, pointers, classes, 
friends, operator overloading, inheritance, virtual functions, templates, linked lists, and 
more. The labs in this folder aimed to increase C++ familiarity, as well as familiarity with 
the aforementioned topics. Coded in C++.

CS14: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms / Advanced C++ Programming. Topics
covered dynamic data structures (linked lists, queues, stacks), introduction to algorithms,
sorting, trees, graphs, and hashing. The labs in this folder aimed to increase C++
familiarity, as well as familiarty with the aforementioned topics. Coded in C++.

CS172: Introduction to Information Retrieval. Topics covered included Vector Model,
Probabilistic IR, IR evaluation methods, Web Search, Social Networks Search, and more.
The program in this folder is the class's final project, and is divided into two phases.
The first phase dealt with building a Web Crawler for .edu pages, and the second phase
dealt with building an index and Web-based search interface. I worked with two others.
We used the Eclipse IDE, and coded in Java.

EE120B: Introduction to Embedded Systems. Topics covered included embedded processor
programing, custom processor design, standard peripherals, memories, interfacing, and
hardware / software tradeoffs. Interdisciplinary laboratory involved used of synthesis
tools (i.e. soldering), programmable logic, microcontrollers, and development of
working embedded systems. For this class, I worked with a breadboard using the Atmega1284
microcontroller, as well as other circuitry parts. I used Atmel Studio, and coded in C.

CS122A: Intermediate Embedded and Real-Time Systems. Topics covered included  hardware and software codesign, advanced programming paradigms (including state machines and concurrent processes), real-time programming and operating systems, basic control systems, and modern chip and design technologies. Laboratories involved use of microcontrollers, embedded microprocessors, programmable logic and advanced simulation, and debug environments. I used Atmel Studio, and coded in C.

CS168: Introduction to VLSI Design. Topics covered included Fabrication, transistor structures, basic transistor behavior,
transistor characteristics, design rules and stick diagrams, reliability and packaging, combinational logic functions and
CMOS logic gates, properties of combinational gates, electrical properties of combinational gates, review of
Synopsys Design Tools and Flow (Custom Designer, Design Compiler, IC Compiler, etc.), wire delay, buffer insertion,
nMOS gates, DCVS logic, domino gates, layou, channel routing, simulation, combinational network delay, logic optimatization,
transistor sizing, interconnect design, crosstalk, power optimization, logic efforts, switch networks, combinational testing, 
hardware description languages, combinational circuit designs in Verilog, sequential machine designs in Verilog, global routing, 
placement, and floorplanning. Laboratories involved use of Synopsys CAD tools (namely Custom Designer). We covered topics
like schematic design, layout design, Design Rule Check (DRC) / Verification (LVS), parasitic extraction using HSPICE, and
RTL Synthesis Design. Target designs included an inverter, 1 bit and 4 bit full adders, a ring oscillator, and Euclid's
Algorithm for GCD.
